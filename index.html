<h3>Azra Hazel K.</h3><br><br>
Hello everyone! My name is Azra and I am currently a student in engineering school. With the help of this blog, I would like to share my passions and my work. <br><br>

I have always had a deep appreciation for art. Whether it’s traditional drawing or digital art on my computer, I find solace in the creative process. Art allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a way that words often cannot. This passion led me to explore different forms of artistic expression, from watercolor to digital illustration. It’s like a world of infinite possibilities in which I can immerse myself. <br><br>

But my love for art is only a part of me. I also have a strong interest in the world of technology. I aspire to become a software developer because I believe that art and technology can coexist in beautiful ways. By merging these two worlds, I hope to create innovative solutions and applications that are not only functional but also aesthetic. <br><br>

Currently, I am working on writing a novel that combines my interests and inspirations in literature. It is a project that is close to my heart and that allows me to integrate my creativity into a story that can captivate those who read it. Writing is another art form that really fascinates me. <br><br>

I firmly believe that mixing art and technology is my future. I want to work in a field where creativity meets innovation. As I continue to learn and grow, I hope to be able to design software that not only works perfectly, but also captivates the user with its artistic elements. <br><br>
